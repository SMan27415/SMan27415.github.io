                <h1>System Analysis and Designing</h1>
                <p>Most, if not all businesses today function on some sort of computer system for data management, automation of processes, communication, etc. Every business has different requirements that must be met with a computer system.
                That's why system designing specifically for a business is crucial for success.</p>
                <p>In my case, <b>I have built a total of three desktop computers all for personal use.</b></p>

                <ol>
                    <li>For mid-high range gaming in 2019.</li>
                    <li>Helped a friend pick out parts and build his computer for gaming in 2022.</li>
                    <li>My extremely high-end gaming computer in 2023.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Even though I've built three personal computers, I'm highly knowledgable with system designing for businesses, with a High Distinction in System Designing at my university.</p>
                <p>For a business to have a well designed computer system, it must go through the design process:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Analyse the Requirements</li>
                    <li>Feasibility Study</li>
                    <li>System Designing</li>
                    <li>System Development</li>
                    <li>Integration and Testing</li>
                    <li>Implementation</li>
                    <li>Maintenance and Support</li>
                </ol>
                <p>This is to ensure the whole development process goes smoothly and the end result is exactly what the client requires.</p>
